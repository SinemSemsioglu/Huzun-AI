            <p>Hüzün, a Turkish word for an emotion known for its
                untranslatability, is the starting point for this project. Instead of
                assuming what a dictionary states, <span class="highlight"> this project questions the
                limits of language, translation and understanding in an ongoing
                    expedition trying to find the meaning of a single word.</span>
            </p>

        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Taking Turkish literature as its starting point, <span class="highlight">we created an
                archive that aims to collect video interviews from translators,
                authors, linguists, psychologists among many other individuals
                that reect upon Hüzün.</span> These interviews form the base for an
                Articial Intelligence architecture that tries to learn the meaning
                of this ungraspable word and represent it. This expedition <span class="highlight">aims
                to exceed the limits of the humane and asks if a machine can
                    “share the same emotions” with humans</span> combining many
                disciplines, from literature to computer science, from
                anthropology to design in the broadest sense of the word.</p>

            <p>The computational science of emotional
            analysis very often investigates emotions
            under universal categories. Most of the
            time, the science takes Paul Ekman’s
            model of six basic emotions as its base;
            anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness
            and surprise. Although, the universality of
            the emotional ux oers science and
            design a common ground, it also loses
            locality and the emotional nuances of
            diverse cultures and the dierences in
            cultural histories. <span class="highlight">A.I.Hüzün takes a
            mechanic look at this local emotion and
            speculates what if Hüzün is analysed by
                    the means of science and technology.</span></p>
