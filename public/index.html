<p id="p1">The HüzünProject is an interdisciplinary research project that has the aim of teaching the concept of
Hüzün to a non-human entity, like an artificial agent.</p>

    <div style="float:left;"><h2>ABOUT</h2></div>
    <p>Hüzün, a Turkish word for an emotion known for its
        untranslatability, is the starting point for this project. Instead of
        assuming what a dictionary states, this project questions the
        limits of language, translation and understanding in an ongoing
        expedition trying to find the meaning of a single word.
    </p>
        <p>Taking Turkish literature as its starting point, we created an
        archive that aims to collect video interviews from translators,
        authors, linguists, psychologists among many other individuals
        that reect upon Hüzün. These interviews form the base for an
        Articial Intelligence architecture that tries to learn the meaning
        of this ungraspable word and represent it. This expedition aims
        to exceed the limits of the humane and asks if a machine can
        “share the same emotions” with humans combining many
        disciplines, from literature to computer science, from
        anthropology to design in the broadest sense of the word.</p>

    <h2>HÜZÜN.<strong>archive</strong></h2>
    <p>The HüzünProject consists of the creation
    of an ongoing video archive where a
    wide-scale of dierent specialists are
    interviewed and shed light on their
    understanding of the word Hüzün.</p>

    <h2>A.I.HÜZÜN</h2>
    <p>The computational science of emotional
    analysis very often investigates emotions
    under universal categories. Most of the
    time, the science takes Paul Ekman’s
    model of six basic emotions as its base;
    anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness
    and surprise. Although, the universality of
    the emotional ux oers science and
    design a common ground, it also loses
    locality and the emotional nuances of
    diverse cultures and the dierences in
    cultural histories. A.I.Hüzün takes a
    mechanic look at this local emotion and
    speculates what if Hüzün is analysed by
        the means of science and technology.</p>

    <h2>HÜZÜN.explorations</h2>
    <p>As one of the outcomes of the research we
    would like to share those ndings and
    openings in public events. This will be a
    live and public event where talks,
    workshops and performances will reect
    upon an undiscovered angle of Hüzün
    and generate a public debate.</p>

    <h2>CONTACT</h2>
    <p>HÜZÜN project is an interdisciplinary, crowdsourced research project. Please feel free to
        ask us any questions.

        We would be very happy if you can contribute to the project by suggesting books, texts,
        stories, images, songs with Hüzün, so that we can improve our archive.

        Or you can be a part of the HÜZÜN project by volunteering to approve texts created by
        A.I.HÜZÜN, whether they have the notion of “HÜZÜN” or not.</p>
